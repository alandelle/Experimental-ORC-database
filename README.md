							
Experimental Organic Rankine Cycle Database
====================

This database aims to gather information on Organic Rankine Cycle experimental units to provide an overview of ORC research and development.
Data are extracted from the scientific literature. Only complete Rankine cycle with organic fluid are considered. COÂ² cycles were not recorded initially. Scientific references covering the same ORC unit are identified and a unique ORC unit ID is allocated. Change of fluid, expander or heat sources on the same unit are tracked with ORC ID subscripts. Missing information are complete with manufacturer data, related scientific references or calculations. Fluid properties are calculated using the open-source Coolprop library.
